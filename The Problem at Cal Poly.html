		<h1 class=essay_title>The Local Issue</h1>
		<p>You have probably heard from staff and students around the Cal Poly talk about the food and dining options being limited and not very fresh. When you generally hear something often being talked down upon in high frequency there is probably some level of truth to the topic. In the case of dining options at Cal Poly, it is true that most of the food options are not very diverse in terms of types of foods.
		</p>
		<h2>Unhealthy environments</h2>
		<p> There are lots of places to eat out from at Cal Poly with there being four main dining halls located across campus and several locations to get food from spread out between the halls. Several of the locations offer healthy options and dishes. However with most of the food establishments being based upon fast food, The inclination to buy something that is healthier when going to a fast food place is outweighed by the more unhealthier options. Even if students opt to head to dining halls with healthy intentions, the availability and locality of more unhealthier food makes impulse purchasing more likely along with the prices of the food options at Cal Poly. Affordability is a major reason why students opt to eat high-fat snacks and meals over healthier ones <a href="./works cited.html#Simone">[1]</a> which often already have a disadvantage in the taste factor. A student’s healthy intentions may be difficult to uphold against heavily promoted and highly accessible fast food options, especially considering the average student’s busy workload that leaves less time for nutritional considerations. The dangerous result of this is students’ impulsive fast food purchases—which form bad habits over a long period of time and are an unsuitable substitute for real food

		Most unhealthy food on campus is based upon the food being fried adding more greases to a meal. Overall research proves that Higher level education facilities attendents are overweight. Although young adults classified as ages 18-35 overall tend to increase in unhealthier BMI's, University students especially have a visible impact upon. The dire food situation on campus is made worse by lackluster grocery options. Campus market, for example—one of the school’s main options for produce—has an extremely limited variety of fruits and vegetables while selling at huge markups. 
		</p>
		<h2>Academic Pressures leading to making unhealthier diet choices</h2>
		<p>
		Most students first arriving at University are experiencing their truly first independenent moments leaving their parents to live on campus. 
		As a result, many students may spend their first few months enjoying the newfound freedom in their diet, including overindulging in established and familiar food preferences. which may lead to making unsustainable choices. However, it is worth noting that pressures from academic life and financial situations can also force students to make unhealthy diet choices. This poor nutrition in turn causes pitfalls in GPA, mental health, and sleep quality <a href="./works cited.html#Burrows">[5]</a> resulting in impulsive fast food consumption, creating a vicious cycle.

		Cal Poly does offer some healthier options in terms of dedicated shops that are more healthier like the campus market. The market offers many healthy options for students who are looking to have a healthy diet. However most of the food at the Campus Market and most similar places sell their foods at generally higher prices than similar establishments. For first year students a meal plan must be purchased for students to be able to purchase food around Campus and is not a option to opt out.
		Meals plans are designed for students to be able to have enough money just for food at values increasing for the type of meal plan a student purchases. The problem is that rising prices of foods on Campus leads to food insecurity and unbalanced diets with students often not being able to purchase enough food to sustain a good diet and often skipping meals due to not enough money or not having time. The prices compared to a local vons[Figure 2] show how much of a difference there is in pricing compared to the Campus Market here at Cal Poly. 
		Prices being double of what is available outside of Campus show how much of a flaw there is in the current dining system with students having to spend money on meal plans with misguiding values when in reality it seems like more of a cash grab by the dining system. </p>

		<p>
		Food choices are affected by many factors in the modern world including, pre-existing preferences, pricing, locality, advertising, time, and accessibility. Cal Poly meets many of these conditions for their students to some extent but pricing is the most important factor for college students who are already on a budget from college costs. Cal Poly’s associated food prices are much higher than comparable establishments. 
		</p>
		<p>
		College students diets can be generalized in terms of there food choices with them being most effected by price and time. Most students do not have the time to make their own meals which are linked to a quality-diet<a href="./works cited.html#Rajshri">[3]</a> as a person usually hand picks their ingredients leading to more awareness of their health and not using industrial practices which make away from home meals more heavy on calories<a href="./works cited.html#Thorpe">[11]</a>.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 Students do not have the time for prepping their own meals because most of the time they are preoccupied with meeting assignment and project deadlines along with other student responsibilites.

		 With Cal Poly being the main provider of fresh produce and healthier options like the Campus Market, It having higher prices than other local dining options leads to many students to opt for cheaper alternatives like fast food places which are franchised so prices are much cheaper for a meal. When students are led to look for these alternatives places many end up purchasing larger portion sizes which are usually cheaper because of the physiological or cognitive mechanisms that fast food places have set in to place to make customers buy more from them. For example, It has been shown that over the life which fast food places have been established serving sizes have increased sharply. Coca Cola for example has seen a 250% increase in portion sizes from 1950 with it first starting from a 6.5oz single serving soft drink to today where a single serving is 20oz.  Larger portions usually costing less also effects how fast-food consumers make decisions with them choosing a larger portion to get a better value without often thinking of the increased calories that come with a larger portion serving<a href="./works cited.html#Simone">[1]</a>

		 <p>
		 This leads students with no other option than grabbing a prepackaged meal or fast food options which are the quickest ways to grab a meal.  This leads to the other factor of pricing because college students generally do not have much cash on them due to them having to pay for their tuition and other college related expense like housing and materials. This leaves usually a fixed budget in terms of meals through the universities dining plan; For example cal poly has a meal plans which distribute dining dollars at a certain rate. This budget for most students leads to them having to choose more options which give them more value which are often fast food places with higher portion sizes due to the value of franchised establishments compared to cal polys Campus Market. Cal Polys meal plans are also know to have the highest prices compared to other CSU's with prices rapidly rising over the years as seen by figure 4. These increases over the years could also be a factor in prices at Cal Poly being much higher compared to stores outside campus at markets with Cal Poly raising its prices with the increase in meal plans to give students less value.

			Cal Poly and all other public universities in California want their students to succeed. As a result they spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on making a better campus for students to foster a environment for success. At Cal Poly for example tutoring is offered for all students included in their tuition and fees along with other free sources like guidance in financial and acadamic fields with advisors and mentors for students.
			</p>
			<p>
			However Cal Poly and a lot of other public universities in California largely ignore the consequences that come with a quality of a diet and do not do enough to promote better health. For example healthier foods on campus are often more expensive when they are coming from the campus markets which are the large providers of fresh produce on campus, creating a bias in students who are already in a tight budget to not be as likely to purchase healthier foods leading to buying more cheaper and often less nutrient dense alternatives to keep them fueled up and awake for a study session or completing assignments which are due. As seen by figure 5 fresh produce is much more expensive than foods which are higher in fats and more unhealthy. This price difference leads to students often not being able or willing to buy enough fresh produce due to the price to maintain a healthy diet leading to malnutrition and changing of diets to more affordable options with more Fats like instant serve noodles or cereals.
			</p>
			<p>
			A unbalanced diet of missing Vegetables and Fruits can be linked to poor academic performance Highlighted by figure 4 where Beta is the correlation to getting more points on a GPA with negative values meaning decreased GPA and vice versa for positive values for their respective values. P meaning the correlation to the data being actually related with lower values being more statistically true. From this data we can prove that having more vegetables and fruits along with foods that scored higher on the Australian Recommended Food Score(ARFS); Can lead to students performing better academically.
