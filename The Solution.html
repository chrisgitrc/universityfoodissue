		<h1 class=essay_title>Fixing Cal Poly's Dining System</h1>
		<p>The environment of food here at Cal Poly and the overall CSU network can be improved significantly through implementations that universities and students can participate in to promote a better future for students diets and academic success.</p>
		<p>
		The solution should be able to work around the current system set in place to create a better conversion and environment for current and future students. There are many things that students have commented on and promoted to make the system better like critisizing the required meal plan purchase for first years living on campus and getting rid of it altogether would allow for more freedom for students to use that money off campus to buy foods from off campus at better rates and values. Although this would be true we have to think about how Cal Poly relies on the meal plans to make revenue and other effects like a fixed cost for dining helping families budget. Removing dining plans would not convey students who are already low on free time to go out of their way to go grocerry shopping when they are already stressed enough from school work. Instead we could use the current system but change the pricing and quality of the food already on campus. This could be done through many way including EBT, lowering on campus pricing, and improving nutritional awareness of college students. We propose a section of WOW to be dedicated to informing more on financial resources and opportunies such as EBT and other financial aid opportunities for students.

		Fixing the dining system would involve Cal Poly having to sacrifice its revenues in the Campus markets and help subsisize current franchises on Campus to lower prices on healthier options to encourage student dining towards more healthier options. Lowering existing prices of Cal Polys campus markets would encourage students purchasing more from the markets leading to better diets with fruits and vegetables which are already sold through the campus markets. subsidizing efforts made by Cal Poly towards franchised establishments like subway and chick-fil-a for healthier menu options could make students and staff more likely to purchase those select items bringing diet quality up for the university. These solutions could be applicable to all public university systems across California to make for better quality diets overall and leaving students more health consciense subsequently raising a new generation into the adult world who are more fit in todays america where the average americans diet is 30% junk food<a href="./works cited.html#Hyman">[14]</a>.

		<h2>Reshaping the current system</h2>
		<p>
		Most universitys in californias have a meal plan which students use to buy food on campus including Cal Poly. Getting rid of the system would not benefit anyone as this would just complicate things for first years and take away from university revenue systems possibly leading to some free services to become paid. Instead working with the current system could work by doing the following: 
		</p>
		<h2>Food Stamps</h2>
		<p>
		Electronic Benefit Transfer or EBT could largely support student dietary health. This is because of the system of Dining Dollars implemented in the CSU system could help when students do not have enough time to go out and pick fruits and vegetables and instead need something quick. Having an EBT card could help students who do not have any cash to be able to get better deals outside of campus when they have free time. Having extra money could also benefit many students who are already tight on cash. Cal Poly currently is doing a good job on promoting EBT but their could be done more like a section pointing out EBT duing orientation to first year students.
		</p>
		<h2>Pricing</h2>
		<p>
		Cal Poly's prices are very inflated comparing surrounding stores outside of campus and lowering prices would not harm Cal Poly if it were for the interest for their students success. Lowering prices in the campus markets would boost sales for fresh produce promoting academic success. Local subsidization of franchised establishments on select menu options could also promote better health choices along with making food insecurity less of an issue at Cal Poly. Lowering prices overall would help many students make more healthy decisions and help students who are already tight on cash not worry about sacrificing their diet and nutrition.
		</p>
		<h2>Our Proposition</h2>
		<p>
		Whether you are a student, staff, parent, or a supporter for student success, The California Public University System needs to change to foster healthier environments for students creating life long healthy food habits. In todays current system students are exposed to unhealthy environments promoting a habit of bad food decisions. Pricing does not help in mitigating this effect with universities like Cal Poly raising prices in their markets. What we propose is to lower prices as this would counteract students being more willing to buy cheaper but less nutrituous food. Lowering prices and subsidization of stores on campus for select itmes would make healthier options more competitive for the students market.
