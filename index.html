		<h1 class=essay_title>Why Cal Poly’s Campus Dining Is Failing Its Students</h1>
		<p>
		College campuses across the nation suffer from poor on-campus food options. Too frequently, these meals lack nutritious quality and are overpriced. Along with not meeting student expectations considering the cost of meal plans, the danger of unhealthy dieting is that it can negatively affect academic performance, mental health, and physical wellbeing. Numerous studies have linked unhealthy diets to increased stress, anxiety, and depression among students while resulting in lowered GPAs.

		Here at Cal Poly SLO, it is paramount that on-campus food is held to a high standard of nutrition in order for all of the student body to be able to perform to the best of their ability without having to worry about their basic physiological needs. Unfortunately, students at SLO frequently opt to eat mostly fast food as it is readily available, convenient, and tasty. Although there are a variety of alternatives across all the dining halls, they are often of mediocre quality and not particularly healthy overall in their own right. They are also not able to compete price-wise with franchised fast-food chain locations that students already are inclined towards. Campus dining prioritizes profit over student health and facilitates the impulsive buying of fast food by busy students who do not have the time or resources to prepare healthy food at home. Those who are looking to avoid fast food are left with no choice but to eat at various subpar restaurants with few truly healthy options. In addition, there is a severe lack of fresh produce on campus, as the food pantry has limited options and the few groceries offered at the Campus Market are unaffordable. The overinflated pricing of all food items, compared to off-campus offerings, means students pay outrageous dining fees. This is particularly an issue for first-year students who are required to purchase a dining plan and live on campus and thus do not have access to off-campus food and grocery. Unfortunately, since these students are also new to being away from home with freedom in their diet, they are prone to gaining weight and forming bad eating habits that may follow them into adult life.

		Cal Poly would be well served by learning from the examples of some of the standout college campuses across the US that have high-rated dining programs. The dining halls in these schools often feature various authentic cuisines offered at premium-style restaurants. These restaurants are no different than any business off-campus—with established tradition, unique style, and high critical praise for their food. Campus dining at SLO should monitor the quality of their restaurants with the same level of scrutiny, to the point where the general public would enjoy dining at one of them. More proven ways to increase the healthiness and accessibility of the food at Cal Poly include expanding food assistance programs, increasing education on the topic of food literacy, and expanding the size of the food pantry and grocery stores.
