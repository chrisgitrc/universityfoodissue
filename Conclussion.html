		<h1 class=essay_title>What you can do</h1>
		<p>If you were hungry looking for something eat what would you think first think of? For most students living at Cal Poly the answer is to eat from the local dining halls. Cal Poly has many different places where you could grab something to eat with lots of different options. This is how it seems at first glance however the food Environment at Cal Poly is not as healthy as it could be. The food Environment at Cal Poly is affected by many different factors inluding, price, diversity, healthiness, and availability. When you look at all the current available dining locations at Cal Poly, fast food is the largest percentage of locations. When students dine they are not worrying about preparing food for themselves most of the time because they are spending time focusing on studying for their classes; As a result fast food has become predominately the largest percent of dine places. This has lead to the decreasing of the average health of Cal Poly because while there are healthy options at Cal Poly, there prescense is not to scale with unhealthier options.  </p>

			<li>Lower Price Points<li>
			<li>More Diversity<li>
			<li>Taste<li>
			<li>Fresh Groceries<li>
			<li>Nutrition<li>
		</ul>
		<p>Theis has lead to many problems for the health of Cal Poly students and University Students in General. Our Proposition to change this is to change the way people view dining options at Universities. Encouraging healthier options like local food hubs would encourage more affordable along with healthier options to students leading a newer fresher balanced diet. These new establishments would also need to be up to standard to the view of students in terms of taste. Grocery Establishments being built on or near Campuses would also need to be built to allow for students to be able to grab indgredients and make meals for themselves. </p>
